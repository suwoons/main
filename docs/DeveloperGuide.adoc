== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `ConsultListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TAbleParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the data of Students, and other data sources named as `{component}TAble` e.g. `ModTAble`.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the TAble data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::module[]
=== Module feature (Written by Nigel Neo)
*TAble* allows NUS SoC teaching assistants to track and record all modules that they are teaching. Users can leave notes on the modules that they are teaching and store a list of links for the module that are useful for reference.

==== Implementation
A module can be stored as a Mod object in TAble (renamed due to naming restrictions on Java keywords). The main components are the module code, which is used to identify unique modules, and module name. Mod can also store the user's notes of the module through its description parameter, as well as a list of module links which are relevant to the course.

.Class diagram of 'Mod' feature, displaying only directly related classes
image::ModClassDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how notes of a module can be updated with the `noteMod` command. Each command is parsed into a ModCode object and the note stored as string. The ModCode is then used to retrieve the appropriate Mod object in `model`. Next, this is used in the Mod constructor to come up with a new Mod with the given note. This new Mod replaces the original Mod in model and the command returns a string indicating success.

.Sequence diagram of updating Mod notes
image::NoteModSequenceDiagram.png[]

Module links are stored as ModLink objects in TAble. The collection of ModLinks are stored as `List<ModLinkPair>` (where a ModLinkPair is actually a class wrapper for a Pair<String, ModLink> object) since each module link can be described differently. This allows for more flexibility in naming the module links, rather than solely using an index based notation, and ensures that the order of addition into the collection is maintained. The activity diagram of adding module links is shown below.

.Activity diagram of adding ModLinks to Mod
image::AddModLinkActivityDiagram.png[]

Users can then view the information associated with a Mod object by using the `viewModInfo` command, and copy module links with the `copyModLink` command. Discussion on the copyModLink command is shown below.

==== Design Considerations

===== Unable to delete module with associated tutorials

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||*Alternative 1: (Current Choice)* Disable deletion of module with associated tutorials
|*Alternative 2 :* Delete module together with its associated tutorials

|*Pros*
|Informs user if there are any dependencies between module to be deleted and tutorials in TAble.
|Fast deletion of module and related objects.

|*Cons*
|User needs to individually delete associated tutorials before module can be deleted.
|Information in TAble will be lost easily as user may not be aware of such an association. As there is no undo command, it will not be easy to undo this command and revert TAble to its original state.
|===

Reason for choosing Alternative 1: On a user design perspective, it is not advisable to delete all objects associated with module, as the user may be unaware of these associated objects. By individually confirming the objects to be deleted, the user is made more aware of any information that they may want to export or save first before deleting said information.

===== ModLink behaviour

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||*Alternative 1: (Current Choice)* Copy link into user's clipboard
|*Alternative 2 :* Open a new browser page

|*Pros*
|Allows for easier access and sharing of link.
|Fast access to module's weblink by directly opening a browser.

|*Cons*
| User needs to open a browser before accessing link.
| Very distracting when opening link, as focus changes from TAble to browser unexpectedly (depending on when browser loads).
|===

Reason for choosing Alternative 1: On a user design perspective, it is less jarring to copy link into the user's clipboard, since the user can choose when they want to access the link and have the flexibility to share the link to others. Additionally, opening a new browser page requires more complicated code that depends on another program.

// end::module[]

// tag::tutorial[]

=== Tutorial feature (Written by Sarah Lim)
*TAble* allows NUS teaching assistants to track and record all the tutorials they are teaching, and maintain details of the tutorial, such as the module it is under, start and end time of the tutorial, and the location it is held.
Tutorials in *TAble* also allow teaching assistants to enroll students in a tutorial and mark their attendance for every week of the semester, and allows for convenient referencing (particularly when there's a pandemic and contact tracing is critical).

==== Implementation
Since a `Tutorial` in *TAble* has to manage many parameters and attributes, different components of *TAble* were distinctly separated in order to ensure maintainability and adhere to good coding practices.
The following illustrates the sequence diagram for AddTutorialCommand, in which a tutorial is added to *TAble*.

.Sequence diagram for the command to add a tutorial
image::TutorialCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

The `LogicManager` is responsible for handling the execution of the user's input command to add a tutorial, calling `parseCommand()`, which returns an `AddTutorialCommand` object
and subsequently calls for the `AddTutorialCommand` object to perform `execute()`. This leads to the `Model` being updated accordingly,
and feedback in the form of a formatted String is finally shown to the user after being returned from `AddTutorialCommand`.

As can be observed, each step of the process is clearly separated, with each component only responsible for single task (eg. parsing user input, executing the actual command etc.)
This enables bugs to be easily caught, and for the process to be structured and comprehensible.

==== Design Considerations
As a `Tutorial` in TAble should be able to keep track of enrolled students and mark their attendance, the `Tutorial` object will have to contain a list of `Student` objects (ie. the enrolled students).
However, a `Student` object, as we are implementing it, does not contain the attribute of whether they are present or not for a particular `tutorial`.

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||*Alternative 1:* Include an attendance attribute to each `Student` such that they keep track of their own attendance for every tutorial they are enrolled in.
|*Alternative 2 : (Current Choice)* Each `Tutorial` contains an attendance sheet, comprised of a list of 11 nested lists of booleans. Each nested list represents each week of a typical NUS school semester, while the size in each of the nested lists corresponds to the number of enrolled students.

|*Pros*
|Efficient to mark the attendance of just a single student, and retrieve all attendance information of a particular `Student`.
|Efficient to mark the attendance of all students in a given tutorial as the whole attendance sheet is stored in `Tutorial`.

|*Cons*
|Difficult to mark attendance of all students in a tutorial as the system will have to individually search and modify the correct boolean in each `Student` in the tutorial.
|Difficult to mark attendance by student instead of tutorial, and inefficient in retrieving attendance information for a particular student as the system will have to iterate through every tutorial that the student is enrolled in.
|===

Reason for choosing Alternative 2:  From a user design perspective, it is more likely that a teaching assistant will want to mark his attendance by tutorial and week rather than by student, hence it is more practical and efficient to choose Alternative 2.
From a software engineering perspective, it is the responsibility of the `Tutorial` to keep track of the attendance, not the `Student` 's.
This allows attendance of a `Student` to be easily referenced and marked in a `Tutorial` without requiring the `Student` to be privy to that information, and allows for convenient retrieval of attendance by week or by student.

As such, the following activity diagram of the system illustrates what occurs when the user calls the markPresent command to mark a student in a tutorial as present, for a specified week in the school semester.

.Activity diagram for the command markPresent in the tutorial feature
image::TutorialMarkPresentActivityDiagram.png[]

When executing the markPresent command, the system will first ensure that all prefixes are present and formatted correctly, before subsequently checking if the specified tutorial exists in the TAble database.
If the tutorial does exist, then the system attempts to retrieve and update the attendance of the respective student in the tutorial. If the student does not exist, an error message is shown, informing the user.
If successful, the updated information is then saved.

// end::tutorial[]

// tag::consult[]
=== Consult feature (Written by Han Ching)
*TAble* allows NUS SoC teaching assistants to track and record all their consultations scheduled with their students.

==== Implementation
A `Consult` class stores all of the relevant information of consults. The class diagram below shows how all the different components interact to allow the consult feature to function. Note that the XYZConsultCommand and XYZConsultCommandParser refers to all Consult related commands like add, edit, delete etc.

.Class diagram of 'Consults' feature
image::ConsultsCommandClassDiagram.png[]

A consultation slot is represented by the `Consult` class which contains 5 key attributes, the `beginDateTime`, `endDateTime`, `location`, `studentMatricNumber` and `studentName`.
The `beginDateTime` and `endDateTime` attributes are represented using Java's `LocalDateTime` class. The `studentMatricNumber` and `studentName` attributes are classes that belong to a certain `Student`. The `studentMatricNumber` is used to uniquely identify the `Student` involved in the consultation, while the studentName is used in the front end of the application, displayed to the TA.

The `XYZConsultCommand` class represent classes that extend the abstract class `Command` and allows the TA to add, edit, delete, view and clear consultations added to TAble. These `XYZConsultCommandS` are created by the respective `XYZConsultCommandParserS`.

A `ConsultTAble` that has a `UniqueConsultList` stores and manages all `ConsultS`. When a `Consult` is added to the ConsultTAble, there will first be a check that the `Consult` does not already exist in the `UniqueConsultList`.

Given the class diagram and the understanding of how the `Consult` class interacts with other classes, let us examine how an `addConsult` command behaves, by using the following activity diagram of the system.

.Activity diagram for the command addConsult in the `Consult` feature
image::AddConsultActivityDiagram.png[]

The workflow above shows how a `Consult` is added and the various checks that occurs at the different points throughout the workflow.

To summarize the above activity diagram, there are 5 key checks which TAble checks for when the user is adding a `consult`. Firstly, TAble checks if all 4 prefixes are present in the command.
Then, TAble checks if all prefixes present are formatted correctly. Following which, TAble will check if each of the data passed for the prefixes are in the right format. Firstly, it checks if
the `Student` index provided is within the range of the `Student` list. Then, it checks if the timing and `Location` provided are in the correct format. Lastly, and most importantly, it checks if the
`Consult` timing provided clashes with other existing `Consult` timings.

==== Design Considerations

===== Consult storing Matric Number and Name

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||*Alternative 1 (Current Choice):* Make the consult store the matric number and name of the student that is attending the consult.
|*Alternative 2 :* Make the consult store the entire Student class that is attending the consult.

|*Pros*
|It is easier to implement and coupling will be reduced as `Student` will not be directly related to the `consult` class.
|It is easier to visualise as the entire `Student` related to the `consult` will be stored.

|*Cons*
|It is not as intuitive as currently, the `Consult` class only stores certain attributes of the `Student` that is attending the `consult`.
|It will be harder to test due to the high degree of coupling.
|===

Reason for choosing Alternative 1: Due to the time constraint of this project, our group has decided to choose alternative 1, as it not only reduces coupling, but is sufficient for us to uniquely identify the `Student` participating in the `consult` as the `MatricNumber` would be unique.

===== Sorting the consults

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||*Alternative 1 (Current Choice):* Automatically sorts the consult list by the time of the consult, whenever a consult is added
|*Alternative 2 :* Sorts the consult list only when user enters a sort command

|*Pros*
|It is intuitive for the consult list to be sorted according to their date and time.
|User can decide how they want the list to be sorted (e.g. by alphabetical order for location).

|*Cons*
|User are not able to sort the list according to their preferences.
|User have to type the sort command each time a new consult is added.
|===

Reason for choosing Alternative 1:  We believe that automatically sorting the consult list provides  a better user experience as the user can immediately see the upcoming consults in the panel, without having to type a sort command.
// end::consult[]

// tag::reminder[]
=== Reminder feature (Written by Cranston Yeo)
*TAble* allows NUS SoC teaching assistants to create reminders to help them in keeping track of their ongoing or upcoming tasks.

==== Implementation
A reminder is made up of a description, date and time which uniquely identify each reminder. Each reminder has a boolean attribute to indicate if the task is done.

To find a reminder in the reminder list, user must key in at least one of the optional predicates, `DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate` or `DatePredicate`. `DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate` contains a list of strings entered by the user while `DatePredicate` contains the input `LocalDate`.

The list of strings are matched against the description of the reminders in the reminder list while the `LocalDate` is matched against the date field. The reminder list is then updated with the list of matching reminders via `updatedFilteredReminderList` in `Model`. Below shows a sequence diagram of the execution.

.Sequence diagram for finding reminders
image::FindReminderSequenceDiagram.png[]

A snooze reminder feature is also implemented for the users to easily postpone a reminder. It's implementation is similar to the `editReminderCommand` where it creates a new reminder to replace the specified reminder instead of editing the current reminder directly. This is to ensure the reminders are immutable which improves the stability of the application.

User can choose to snooze the reminder in any/all of the following time units: days, hours and/or minutes. Only positive integer are allowed as the user are not supposed to snooze the reminders backwards or snooze it by zero duration. Reminders that are done are also not allowed to be snoozed. Following is an activity diagram for the command.

.Activity diagram for the command snoozeReminder in the reminder feature
image::SnoozeReminderActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Sorting the reminders

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||*Alternative 1 (Current Choice):* Automatically sorts the reminder list whenever a reminder is added
|*Alternative 2 :* Sorts the reminder list only when user enters a sort command

|*Pros*
|It is intuitive for the reminder list to be sorted according to their done status and deadline.
|User can decide how they want the list to be sorted (e.g. in alphabetical order).

|*Cons*
|User are not able to sort the list according to their preferences.
|User have to type the sort command each time a new task is added.
|===

Reason for choosing Alternative 1:  We believe that automatically sorting the list provide with a better user experience as they could immediately see the most urgent tasks in the reminder's list upon startup without first typing a sort command.

===== Ways to inform user about their upcoming tasks

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||*Alternative 1: (Current Choice)* Each reminder displays the duration left before the task is due
|*Alternative 2 :* A pop-up notification when a reminder is due or about to due

|*Pros*
| User could see clearly the duration left for each task at a glance.
| User are notified of upcoming tasks without having to look through the list of reminders.

|*Cons*
| Reminders that are about to due could be missed out.
| Multiple pop-up notifications from the reminders could cause annoyance for the user.
|===

Reason for choosing Alternative 1: Pop-up notifications can be intrusive and potentially cause lag to the program which negatively impacts user's experience.
Furthermore, they are hard to test due to their volatile nature and including them might decrease the stability of the application.
// end::reminder[]

// tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar feature (Written by Han Ching)
*TAble* allows NUS SoC teaching assistants to bring up a calendar view of all their upcoming consults, tutorials and reminders.

==== Implementation
The key command which users can call is the `viewCalendar` command.

Most functions to display the calendar window are called within the `CalendarWindow` class, as it is the main class that drives the calendar view.
The `CalendarWindow` class extends `UiPart<Stage>`, and represents the calendar using a `GridPane` as the skeleton of the calendar, with individual dates being populated by a `CalendarDay` class which extends `UiPart<Region>`.
The `CalendarDay` has a `StackPane` that displays the number of `ConsultS`, `TutorialS` and `ReminderS` each day.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how the Calendar is initialised, each time the TAble app is set up.

.Sequence diagram of creation of Calendar
image::CalendarWindowSequenceDiagram.png[]

The above sequence diagram illustrates how the Calendar is initialised when the TAble app is start up. Thus, whenever the user inputs the `viewCalendar` command,
this calendar window is brought up, similar to how the Help window is brought up as well. The calendar window brought up will show the calendar view of the current month and year.

The calendar window also stores the `UniqueConsultList`, `UniqueTutorialList` and the `UniqueReminderList`. As seen in the sequence diagram above, the calendar window checks for the consults, tutorials and reminders in the 3 lists, to see if they are on a particular date.
If they occur on that date, the `StackPane` in `CalendarDay` will be updated to reflect the corresponding number of consults, tutorials and reminders.
As seen in the screenshot below, the number of reminders, tutorials and consults will not clash, as they take up the top, middle and bottom rows respectively.

.Screenshot of how the number of reminders, tutorials and consults are displayed on the same day
image::CalendarReminderTutConsult.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Displaying calendar as a separate window

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||*Alternative 1 (Current Choice):* Displaying the calendar view as a separate window.
|*Alternative 2 :* Having a calendar view permanently by the side of TAble.

|*Pros*
|It is clearer and less visually clunky for the user, as information overload is prevented.
|It is more intuitive, as the user can always view the calendar at the side for his upcoming schedules.

|*Cons*
|Lower user experience as the user has to type in a command to view the calendar.
|The UI may be too cluttered as there are already alot of information being displayed currently.
|===

Reason for choosing Alternative 1:  We believe that our current implementation of the UI has all of TAble's core features, and the calendar view can and should
be implemented as a separate window to prevent visual clutter. The command to view the calendar window command is also short and intuitive to remember, thus the user experience
would likely not be significantly affected.

// end::calendar[]

=== Common Design Considerations

==== Length of command prefixes (For all features)

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||*Alternative 1 (Current Choice):* Make the prefixes of the command descriptive, such as `student/`.
|*Alternative 2 :* Make the prefixes of the commands short, by using the first few letters of the command word, such as `s/` for students.

|*Pros*
|It is more clear and intuitive for the user to type in the full prefix.
|It is easier for the user to type in shorter command prefixes, so that it is less tedious to input the commands.

|*Cons*
|Lower user experience as the user has to type in longer commands to use the TAble application.
|It may be confusing for the user, as certain command prefixes may share similar initials, such as `tags` and `time`.
|===

Reason for choosing Alternative 1:  We believe that the user experience will be better when using more descriptive command prefixes, as the user will not be required to constantly check on the user guide since the command prefixes are intuitive. Furthermore, TAble comes with the autocomplete feature which removes the hassle of typing out long prefixes.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
